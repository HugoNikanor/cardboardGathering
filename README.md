#Cardboard Gathering
*Totaly not inspired by a certain other game...*

This is a card game I'm writing for a school project.

---

## Features
Both added and nonadded

* Moving of cards
* Database where you can create your own deck
* Online multiplayer

I have no plans to add actual game rules.

## Running
If you have the following the program should probably run:
* Java 8
* JavaFX 8
* A computer

The main class is in 
	central.Main
