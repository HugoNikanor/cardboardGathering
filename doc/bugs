Card rotation
	if starting in rotated mode, and clicked about twice every second
	after maybe 15s of clicking the rotating mechanism will be bricked

Card move network
	Card move data sent over the network have LARGE syncing
	problems. This can probably be changed by sending real
	coordinates instead of changes in coordinates

Design
	cards on the oponent battlefield are transparent
	probably caused by a missmatch between the two
	constructors for card

Card move
	When holding down a movement key and taking focus away from the window
	the card gets stuck in the movement statte
	Could free it by "shaking" it.
	Testet with Left-arrow key
