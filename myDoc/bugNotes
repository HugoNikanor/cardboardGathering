cardChooser back button

notify button
alarm notify button

better zoom on oponents cards


graphics doesn't start for player with smaller deck

better way to check if a deck is correctly built

card may be put back into collection when zooming (far from deck)

part of program responsible for card desingn may crash,
	But this doesn't happen often


the part of the code responsible for checking if the card is over a collection
quite often crashes the javaFX application thread. This is very fatal.
	This may be fixed when I made the collections synchronized

print how many cards the other player has on hand

When card in hand (in leftmost position) is zoomed then some cards on battlefield
doesn't respend as well when pressing them to tap


tokens added to cards in "Get Card" aren't remebered
"Get Card" doesn't scroll
