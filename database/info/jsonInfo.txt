database/
is the folder where all the database files should reside. All files there will
be read into the programs. Any directories will however be ignored.

When creating databases, follow the sample in the accompanying file: sample.json.
All fields in the objects present in the "cards" array can be removed. But I
would STRONGLY recommend that you at least keep "name".

"manaCost" have multiple {x} blocks. For colorless mana, start with an {n} block,
where 'n' is an integer value.
You can also use:
	{B} - Black
	{U} - Blue
	{G} - Green
	{R} - Red
	{W} - White
These five can appear in any order, and any number of each of these

If a NULL value is desired for any of the fields, just refrain from having the
key present.
